# CleaningDataProject

This project involved getting data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip, cleaning it and producing a tidy data set of an aggregated view of the data. 

The run_analysis.R script is used to read the data, transform it and produce a csv with the desired aggregated tidy dataset.

The CodeBook.md describes the variables and the data used in the final aggregated tidy dataset produced by the run_analysis.R script.
